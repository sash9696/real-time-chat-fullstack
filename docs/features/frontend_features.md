# ðŸŽ¨ Detailed Frontend Features

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the next-generation frontend features for the real-time chat application.

---

### 1. Dark/Light Theme Toggle

- **Description**: Implement a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between a light and dark mode. The selected theme should be persisted across sessions.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use CSS variables for color schemes.
  - Create a `ThemeContext` to provide theme state to all components.
  - Store the user's preference in `localStorage`.
  - Add a UI control (e.g., a toggle switch) in the settings or main navigation.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Seamless transition between themes with no visual glitches.
  - Theme preference is remembered when the user returns to the app.

### 2. Advanced Responsive Design

- **Description**: Enhance the existing responsive design to be truly mobile-first and provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes, from small phones to large desktops.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use Tailwind CSS's responsive variants (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
  - Adapt layouts for touch-based interactions (e.g., larger tap targets).
  - Test on a wide range of real devices and emulators.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - All UI elements are easily accessible and usable on mobile devices.
  - No horizontal scrolling on any screen size.

### 3. Rich Media Support

- **Description**: Allow users to send and receive various types of media, including images, videos, and files. This also includes support for voice messages.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **File Uploads**: Use a service like AWS S3 or Cloudinary for storing media files.
  - **API**: Create new backend endpoints for handling file uploads and retrieving media.
  - **Frontend**:
    - Add a file attachment button to the message input.
    - Display image and video previews directly in the chat.
    - Implement a file viewer for other file types.
    - For voice messages, use the `MediaRecorder` API to capture audio.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Users can upload and view media files up to a certain size limit (e.g., 25MB).
  - Voice messages can be recorded and played back within the app.

### 4. Message Threading and Replies

- **Description**: Enable users to reply to specific messages, creating a threaded conversation. This helps to keep conversations organized, especially in busy group chats.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Data Model**: Update the `Message` model to include a `parentMessageId` field.
  - **UI**:
    - Add a "Reply" option to each message.
    - When replying, show the original message in a quoted format.
    - Display threaded replies indented or in a separate view.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Users can easily reply to messages and view threaded conversations.
  - Threaded replies are clearly distinguishable from regular messages.

### 5. Virtual Scrolling for Large Chat Histories

- **Description**: To ensure high performance with large chat histories (e.g., 10,000+ messages), implement virtual scrolling (or "windowing"). This technique renders only the visible messages in the viewport, significantly improving performance.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use a library like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
  - The component will need to know the height of each message to calculate the scroll position.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - The app remains responsive and smooth even when scrolling through thousands of messages.
  - Memory usage stays low, regardless of the number of messages in a chat.
